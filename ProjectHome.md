Framework created for making easy to use java 'scripts' for changing android phones using linux commands.

Framework can be easily extended to other tasks as well.

Original use was for 'One Click Lag Fix' for the Samsung Galaxy S series, to create a loopback EXT2 device on top of Samsung's RFS in order to improve response time for applications.
